While businesses and organizations depend on machine learning and predictive analytics to make decisions in today's data-centric society, predictive analytics furthers this by using machine learning and statistical models to forecast future trends and behaviors based on past data (Shmueli and Koppius, 2011).
The focus is on classification and clustering problems using Python. The objective of the bill_authentication.csv dataset is to distinguish between real banknotes and fake ones based on features characterizing various aspects of banknotes. I will research different machine learning techniques, including decision trees for classification, K-means for clustering, linear regression for predictive analysis.
